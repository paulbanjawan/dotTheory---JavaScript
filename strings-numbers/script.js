/* Challenge 1 : Imagine you have 10 images on a web page. 
Each image is 190 pixels wide. Using the two variables in this script, 
create a new variable named totalWidth that multiplies width by totalImages. 
Since the value of width is a string, you'll need to use a built-in JavaScript 
function to retrieve the number value.
*/

const width = '190px';
const totalImages = 10;

let totalWidth = parseInt(width) * totalImages;

console.log(totalWidth);
